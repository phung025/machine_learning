# machine_learning

Hello! This repository contains every documents that I've studied in my journey into the field of machine learning (ML). As a CS student, I have planned to learn about machine learning by attending the course offered by my university. However, it was very difficult to get into this class, I knew that being able to get a seat there would be a difficult task. Since then, I decided to study machine learning by myself in case I didn't make it into the course. 

In here, you can find youtube videos discussing ML that I found interesting and educational. It also contains some papers that I've read to learn more about ML. Finally, you can also find my own implementations of the machine learning algorithms that I learned from the machine learning course offered by Standford University (and probably some other courses that I'm gonna take in the future).
